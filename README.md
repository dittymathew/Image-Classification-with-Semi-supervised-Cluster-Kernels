# Image-Classification-with-Semi-supervised-Cluster-Kernels

The problem of image classification is suited for cluster kernel assumption because
similar images have similar objects appearing in them at different places. In
this project, the idea of cluster kernel combined with a semi-supervised approach
of classifier training is used for image classification and the performance of the
classifier on two different datasets is analysed. The performance is also compared
with a non kernel classifier both in a supervised and semi-supervised setting.

The task is to classify the images into predefined categories by using semi-supervised approach. Here we are comparing the performance of non-kernel method such as semi-supervised GMM with semi-supervised cluster kernel method.
